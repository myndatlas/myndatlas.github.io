# §ScratchPad

Like the [[Scratch Query Note]] and [[Scratch Dataview Note]], this note is permanently in the [[§ScratchBox]] though it's contents are transient. It is seldom completely empty, though the aim is to have it as empty as possible at all times and to move things from here to other notes or delete them when no longer needed.

(When using the Workbench plugin, this is my workbench note. When using workspaces, this is one of the notes in my Home workspace.)

This is a place to make notes to myself or draft things or paste things as a temporary holding place when working on other notes. It's a kind of notepad, in a sense, where pages get torn off and filed elsewhere (or discarded) so to leave a fresh sheet for future work. 

I have only one of these notes, though I have experimented with more. My preference is to have notes be more securely located as soon as possible, and having them all on one page that I'm trying to keep clear seems to work better for me than having more of these. (Which is not to say that I'm not constantly leaving tasks for myself on other notes, which are then caught in the queries on the ScratchBox note.)

### Cut from [[Welcome to the MyndAtlas Project]]:

 [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) 

Although this is written somewhat in the style of a manual or a guide, the primary aim is to be useful to the stranger that is my future self; while I hope it may be useful to other strangers (or friends!), that is not the aim of this project, at least, not yet.

To add:
- More about how I got started and how things evolved.
- More about the tools and how to get set up
- What the idea of a note-system is and who my major influences are

### Cut from [[How I got here]]
I started using Bear's facility to wikilink headings as a way of transcluding pieces of one note into another and leaned on tags for a bit too many purposes. As the note-system grew, things were getting unwieldy; each added note felt like I was adding to the chaos that I simply couldn't wrangle the way I wanted to. Even though I could have two instances open using the iPad's Split view, I seldom felt like I could see enough at once, which added to the chaos
