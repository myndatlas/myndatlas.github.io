# Welcome to the MyndAtlas Project

This website is part of a project ([[Â¶The MyndAtlas Project]]) to document and explain my thinking about using a note system ([[âœ¶Note-Systems]]) and create an explanatory example, of sorts. I am still working out how best to approach this piece of the puzzle with my current skill levels.

One of the nuances of my particular use-case is that I have periods where my brain doesn't really work. It's very frustrating and difficult to come back from. Although using a note-system doesn't eliminate these pain points, it does make it less painful, make setbacks less then they might be (I hope), to rediscover what I was doing when previously in the note-system. Certainly more is possible through this than any other tool.

Original text:
The MyndAtlas Project is collection of notes documenting current thoughts and  processes and other information about developing my note-system and my current way of working with it. Although over time I hope it may be useful to others, the focus in the short term is to document the things that I would have found useful to know earlier on, and to mark a trail for myself if I needed to start again.

Even after about two years years of working with my note-system, things remain very much in flux, especially as I discover new ways to make use of the many available tools. Some of what's here is very specific to my use case, though it's also clear that there are a number of similarities with what I'm doing here to what others are doing with similar note-systems and related personal knowledge management (PKM) work.

Head over to the [[Â§Atlas]] to see a bit about how I organise and structure my note-system and enter the notes that way or have a look at [[State of the MyndAtlas Project]] for notes on the current status of the MyndAtlas Project.
