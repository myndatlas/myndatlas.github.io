# Welcome to the MyndAtlas Project

Apologies for the mess. It's a side effect of the idea of Working in Public and Digital Gardens and all that, for better and worse.

I've taken several runs at it and changed my mind a few times, learning as I go. I recently deleted a lot and am rethinking how to proceed.

Seeing a draft in progress helps clarify my thinking and I get better ideas before I finish implementing them. I'm still working on the forward momentum part but it's honestly delightful to feel like it's working, even if it's only *partly* working.

You can check the <a href="{{'/notes' | relative_url}}">notes feed</a> to see what's recently been added or updated, but, for now: chaos reigns.
