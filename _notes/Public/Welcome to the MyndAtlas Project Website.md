# Welcome to the MyndAtlas Project Website

The current state of 

At the moment, this is a collection of pages that don't yet make a cohesive whole. It's a part of a work in progress to document what I'm doing and thinking as I build my note-system and develop a way of working with it that meets my particular needs[^1]. 

A major aim of this site is to try to document the things that would help me get back to this point if for some reason I had to start over, written so they could be followed by someone else.

Some of what's here is very specific to my use case, though it's also clear that there are a number of similarities with what I'm doing here to what others are doing with similar note-systems and related personal knowledge management (PKM) work.

Head over to the [[§Atlas]] to see a bit about how I organise and structure my note-system and enter the notes that way or have a look at [[State of the MyndAtlas Project]] for notes on the current status of the MyndAtlas Project. You can also check the <a href="{{'/notes' | relative_url}}">notes feed</a> to see what's recently been added or updated.
