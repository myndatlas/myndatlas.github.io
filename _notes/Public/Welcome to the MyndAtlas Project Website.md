# Welcome to the MyndAtlas Project Website



This website is part of a project to document and explain my thinking about using a note system and create an explanatory example, of sorts. 

One of the nuances of my particular use-case[^1] is that I am only intermittently capable of this level of thought-work. Although using a note-system doesn't eliminate the pain points of dealing with my limitations, it does make it less painful, and make it easier to rediscover what I was doing before my symptoms so rudely interrupted me.

Original text:
The MyndAtlas Project is collection of notes documenting current thoughts and  processes and other information about developing my note-system and my current way of working with it. Although over time I hope it may be useful to others, the focus in the short term is to document the things that I would have found useful to know earlier on, and to mark a trail for myself if I needed to start again.

Even after about two years years of working with my note-system, things remain very much in flux, especially as I discover new ways to make use of the many available tools. Some of what's here is very specific to my use case, though it's also clear that there are a number of similarities with what I'm doing here to what others are doing with similar note-systems and related personal knowledge management (PKM) work.

Head over to the [[§Atlas]] to see a bit about how I organise and structure my note-system and enter the notes that way or have a look at [[State of the MyndAtlas Project]] for notes on the current status of the MyndAtlas Project. You can also check the <a href="{{'/notes' | relative_url}}">notes feed</a> to see what's recently been added or updated.
