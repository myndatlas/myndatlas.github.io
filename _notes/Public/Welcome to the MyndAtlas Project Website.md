# Welcome to the MyndAtlas Project Website

This website is part of a project to document and explain my thinking about using a note-system. It is also a selection of notes extracted from my working note-system, so it should eventually show some of the principles in action in ways that I hope will be useful to others (not least: my future self). At the time of writing, it's still very much a work in progress, though, and I expect it will be for a wee while yet.

The aim is to leave a trail of breadcrumbs for myself so I can pick up where I've left off, written well enough that they could be followed by a stranger.

One of the nuances of my particular use-case[^1] is that I am only intermittently capable of this level of thought-work. Although using a note-system doesn't eliminate the pain points of dealing with my limitations, it does make it less painful, and make it easier to rediscover what I was doing before my symptoms (so rudely) interrupted me. I can't work consistently, so anything that helps me pick up where I left off makes a significant, tangible difference in a way that's quite obvious in my case. The problems I'm solving, though, are universal ones: all work is really iterative work (in my opinion, I suppose I'll have to back this up at some point), so tools that facilitate iterative work help us work more effectively. That's why things like versioning are so bloody useful, and tools (like git) that make it easy make such a difference to what an individual can achieve without such tools, nevermind what we can do collectively.

Original text:
The MyndAtlas Project is collection of notes documenting current thoughts and  processes and other information about developing my note-system and my current way of working with it. Although over time I hope it may be useful to others, the focus in the short term is to document the things that I would have found useful to know earlier on, and to mark a trail for myself if I needed to start again.

Even after about two years years of working with my note-system, things remain very much in flux, especially as I discover new ways to make use of the many available tools. Some of what's here is very specific to my use case, though it's also clear that there are a number of similarities with what I'm doing here to what others are doing with similar note-systems and related personal knowledge management (PKM) work.

Head over to the [[§Atlas]] to see a bit about how I organise and structure my note-system and enter the notes that way or have a look at [[State of the MyndAtlas Project]] for notes on the current status of the MyndAtlas Project. You can also check the <a href="{{'/notes' | relative_url}}">notes feed</a> to see what's recently been added or updated.
