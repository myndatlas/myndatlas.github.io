# Welcome to the MyndAtlas Project Website

At the moment, this is a collection of notes


It is also a selection of notes extracted from my working note-system, so it should eventually show some of the principles in action in ways that I hope will be useful to others (not least: my future self). At the time of writing, it's still very much a work in progress, though, and I expect it will be for a wee while yet.

The aim is to leave a trail of breadcrumbs for myself so I can see what I've done and pick up where I left off, written well enough that they could be followed by a stranger.

Original text:
The MyndAtlas Project is collection of notes documenting current thoughts and  processes and other information about developing my note-system and my current way of working with it. Although over time I hope it may be useful to others, the focus in the short term is to document the things that I would have found useful to know earlier on, and to mark a trail for myself if I needed to start again.

Even after about two years years of working with my note-system, things remain very much in flux, especially as I discover new ways to make use of the many available tools. Some of what's here is very specific to my use case, though it's also clear that there are a number of similarities with what I'm doing here to what others are doing with similar note-systems and related personal knowledge management (PKM) work.

Head over to the [[§Atlas]] to see a bit about how I organise and structure my note-system and enter the notes that way or have a look at [[State of the MyndAtlas Project]] for notes on the current status of the MyndAtlas Project. You can also check the <a href="{{'/notes' | relative_url}}">notes feed</a> to see what's recently been added or updated.
