# Welcome to the MyndAtlas Project

Apologies for the mess. It's a side effect of the idea of Working in Public, for better and worse.

At the moment, this is a collection of pages that were part of a work in progress that has been restarted more than once, without ever getting to a remotely cohesive point. 

Some of what's here is very specific to my use case, though it's also clear that there are a number of similarities with what I'm doing here to what others are doing with similar note-systems, second brains, zettelkastens, and even commonplace books. I don't try to be comprehensive, but I inevitably draw from number of related personal knowledge management (PKM) work/ideas and I'm standing on the shoulders of giants.

These are old links and are navigated at your own risk, for now. I aim to update them soon.
Head over to the [[§Atlas]] to see a bit about how I organise and structure my note-system and enter the notes that way or have a look at [[Status of the MyndAtlas Project]] for notes on the current status of the MyndAtlas Project. You can also check the <a href="{{'/notes' | relative_url}}">notes feed</a> to see what's recently been added or updated.
