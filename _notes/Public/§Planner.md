# §Planner

The planner branches off from this note, currently via a list of years from which all other planner notes branch off at the relevant point. 

This page also holds some lists from queries for ease of access to the current year, month, week, and day, as well as a view of all the daily notes for the current week. 

There needs to be a better way to do the dashboard.

## Planner Dashboard
I am experimenting with a dashboard currently generated via a template to show links to the pages for:
### Current Links
- This Year
- This Month
- This Week (and another section with other days this week already created)

## Planner
- Links to all years for which there are notes so far, which then branch in to the yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily notes.

## To Consider
- A section currently catching things I've deferred to think about later and wasn't sure where else to put them for now. (Current situation is not robust.)
