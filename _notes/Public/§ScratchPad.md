# §ScratchPad
- [ ] this needs disambiguation with [[The ScratchPad]]

Like the [[Scratch Query Note]] and [[Scratch Dataview Note]], this note is permanently in the [[§ScratchBox]] though it's contents are transient. It is seldom completely empty, though the aim is to have it as empty as possible at all times and to move things from here to other notes or delete them when no longer needed.

This is a place to make notes to myself or draft things or paste things as a temporary holding place when working on other notes. It's a kind of notepad, in a sense, where pages get torn off and filed elsewhere (or discarded) so to leave a fresh sheet for future work. 

I have only one of these notes at the time of writing, officially, though the number of notes waiting in the [[§ScratchBox]] for further action is larger than I'd like, which at times can be like having more than one. My preference is to have notes be more securely located as soon as possible, and having them all on one page that I'm trying to keep clear seems to work better for me than having, say, "transient" notes on a [[Daily Note]] page which I then have to go find/collect later. (Which is not to say that I'm not constantly leaving tasks for myself on other notes, which are then caught in the queries on the ScratchBox note. I am. I'm just handling them a different way.)
