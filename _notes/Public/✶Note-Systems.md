# ✶Note-Systems
- [ ] To Do: Make this work on the website. Sorry it's mostly broken links for now!

## Extracted from my `✶Note-Systems` note:
> [!NOTE+] This note has been extracted directly from my vault and contains many broken links.

> "And if one has to write anyway, it is useful to take advantage of this activity in order to create in the system of notes a competent partner [in] communication." [^1]

#### What it is - and what to call it
- [[What a note-system is]]
- [[Note-system is a much better concept handle (compared to alternatives)]]
- [[The perception and understanding of this tool is heavily influenced by the kind of work one does with it]]


#### Why Use a Note-System
- [[Why use a Note-System Practice]] - should this replace the header here? should these all link to it???
- [[Using a note-system helps overcome memory and cognitive limitations]]
- [[Note-systems offer opportunites for spaced repetition]]
- [[Already keeping more in my working memory from using a prototype]]

#### Metaphors?
- [[We aren't literally "communicating" with note-systems (they're inanimate)]]
- [[We communicate with ourselves across time using note-systems]]

#### On the PRACTICE of using a note-system
- [[A note-system is a supportive part of a larger process]]
- [[A concept handle for the larger process that a note-system is part of is needed]]
- [[Lacking an explicit concept is holding back and preventing the development of our thinking]]

#### Creating a Note-System
- [[The tools used will influence the note-system]]
- [[Problem of effective process and structure, solved emergently, iteratively, over time]]
- [ ] something about frameworks? (Mine, Nick Milo's etc)
- [[Challenges for those creating their own note-system by adapting the practices of Luhmann and others]]
- [[Advantages of Digital Implementations]]
- [[Establishing how to best work with a note-system to support our work is a complex problem requiring emergent solutions]]
- [ ] A starting place? [[Every zettelkastener has a collection of notes about zettelkastening]]
- [[A serious context of use isn't necessary for an effective and useful note-system (but it probably is necessary for a "zettelkasten style" note-system? maybe?)]]
- [[It is a mistake to focus on Luhmann's physical implementation alone]], because [[Unconscious physical-limitation-carryover in modern zettelkasten culture]]
- [[Addressing the need for a "sandbox" in digital implementations (to replicate the functionality of a physical desktop)]]

#### Organising/Categorising Notes?
- [[Note taxonomies]]
- [[Backlinks have their uses,  mainly housekeeping]]
- [[Some note-systems may be highly-navigable commonplace books or "personal wiki"s]]
- [[Top links - comparing conceptions of parent, up, and crosslinks]]
- [[Structure and hub notes]]

#### Making Notes
- [[Atomic notes]]
- [[NoMa Method - LYT]]

#### Relationship to Bibliography
- [[Is a separate RMS necessary?]]

#### "Products"?
- [[Note-system supported thinking for creativity - applications for fiction such as World building made easier by interlinked notes?]]

#### Related Concepts
- [[Folgezettel - concept]]
- [[Commonplace Book]] 
- [[Luhmann's Zettelkasten]]
