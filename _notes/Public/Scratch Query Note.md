# Scratch Query Note

Like the [[ScratchPad]] and [[Scratch Dataview Note]] the contents of this note change often. The note is permanently in the [[ScratchBox]] for ease of access and use while working on other notes. It holds the bones of a query to be modified as needed (to save me having to type it where that's convenient, especially when using Obsidian on my phone.)

The query codeblock embeds the search results in the note, rather than having a list in the search pane. I used these a lot early on, but increasingly find that using Dataview does what I want much more readily.
