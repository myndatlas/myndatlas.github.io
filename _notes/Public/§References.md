This is very out of date.

Original text:
This note contains a number of dataview lists to notes about my sources which I endeavour to credit correctly. 

Many users of digital note-systems I have come across advocate for a seperate resource managment system. I am experimenting with this idea (options are currently limited on the iPad), but for now I am including the full reference record in a note here, which also hold dataviews gathering information about where I have referred to this source.

(Even when I am using a separate RMS, I am mainly using it to generate the correct Bibliography entry for the note and the RMS---Zotero at this time---only has the information as a side effect of having entered the ISBN  and extracting a theoretically correct citation with very little effort from me at that stage.

I am using a naming convention for Bibliography files that aligns with The Chicago Manual of Style, Author-Date format, with note titles generally as: Author-Date-Short Title. This is mainly out of the convenience of the convenience of "Author-Date" as a handle. Markdown has some options for footnotes which I may make use of, where I will link to the note that contains the Author-Date style bibliographic reference.
