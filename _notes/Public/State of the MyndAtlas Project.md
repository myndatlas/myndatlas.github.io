# State of the MyndAtlas Project
After a failed experiment with an upgrade I discovered that I prefer where I've ended up with this website. That's the nature of it sometimes, I suppose.

## Current Status
- I followed the instructions I found in the [Jekyll Garden](https://jekyll-garden.github.io) [How To](https://jekyll-garden.github.io/post/how-to) page.
- I have been using Obsidian Sync to get everything between devices which is working well, as ever.
- The Notes Feed seems to be working.
- I have been tweaking the code and adding things to move it in the direction I'm aiming for, just like I would "working in" my own note-system.
- I have been editing HTML directly on the github website from the iPad because there's something that keeps tripping me up about Working Copy and this is easier/faster than figuring it out, for now. This is a bad idea and I need to find an alternative - it's far more difficult to revert changes than I would like this way.
