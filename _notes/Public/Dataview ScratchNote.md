# Dataview ScratchNote
- [ ] To do: create a correct link for Dataview to explain what I mean with all that.

This is one of my most often used notes at the time of writing. Dataview really changed my vision of what was possible in the note-system and so far that has been even more true than I anticipated. This note can get lengthy as I get distracted and need more dataviews before others have finished their usefulness. (More about all this later.)

From the earlier site:

Like the [[ScratchPad]] and [[Scratch Query Note]] the contents of this note change often. The note is permanently in the [[ScratchBox]] for ease of access and use while working on other notes. It holds the bones of a dataview query to be modified as needed (to save me having to type it where that's convenient, especially when using Obsidian on my phone.)

The general template contains the below, inside a dataview code block:

LIST/TABLE/TASK
FROM
WHERE
SORT
