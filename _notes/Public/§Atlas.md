# §Atlas
- [ ] To Do: Add a link/note for "The Dashboard"

This is a part of my note-system that I think sets it apart somewhat from other things I've seen in this space: a scaffolding for building notes into something much larger and making developing a note-system easier.

---
## What is the The Atlas?
The Atlas is really three things:
1. a framework for thinking about how notes come together
2. a collection of notes with code that makes lists automatically to make it easier to make rich content
3. a single, central note that all other notes link back to

---
## For this website, this note is the Atlas note (obviously)

In my note-system, this is the central page that everything links back to. Some might call it an index or register (especially if they've been reading about [Luhmann's Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)). If the rest of the notes are branches, this note is the one they all branch from.

Thus: everything in my note-system can be accessed following links from this note, via one or more paths through other notes.

---
### Content and Layout
I continue to experiment with different ways to have notes branch of from here and how to group them, and so far usually have two to three groups of short lists of links.

1. The first is a group of working notes that might be thought of as being permanently "in" the [[ScratchBox]] - they have it as the uplink.
		- The [[ScratchPad]].
		- The [[Scratch Dataview Note]].
		- The [[Scratch Query Note]].
		- The [[The Dashboard]]

2. A List of the rest of the notes at the "section" level that branch off from the Atlas. They have a `§` in the note title and [[§Atlas]] note as a parent.  I have called these both atlasNotes and sectionNotes at various points.

Something about [Nick Milo's "Maps Of Content"](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/MOCs+Overview) (I don't want to just start using his term without deeper consideration but I'm not sure my AtlasNotes aren't conceptually quite similar to Maps of Content at least in some ways.)
