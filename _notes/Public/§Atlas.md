# §Atlas

In my note-system, this is the central page that everything links back to. Some might call it an index or register (especially if they've been reading about [Luhmann's Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)). If the rest of the notes are branches, this note is the one they all branch from.

Thus: everything in my note-system can be accessed following links from this note, via one or more paths through other notes.

I continue to experiment with different ways to have notes branch of from here and how to group them.

1. The first is a group of notes that are permanent "ScratchNotes" - notes that "in" the [[ScratchBox]] (have it as the uplink).
		- The [[ScratchPad]].
		- The [[Scratch Dataview Note]].
		- The [[Scratch Query Note]].


<!--
2. The rest are various groupings of other notes by interest or other grouping from which it makes sense to have them branch off from the Atlas note. These can fluctuate depending on what I'm using the most or current thoughts organisation.
		- I call these notes [[AtlasNotes]]. In some cases they are very similar to [Nick Milo's "Maps Of Content"](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/MOCs+Overview) (I don't want to just start using his term without deeper consideration but I'm not sure my AtlasNotes aren't conceptually quite similar to Maps of Content at least in some ways.)
