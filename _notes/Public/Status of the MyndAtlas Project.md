# Status of the MyndAtlas Project

## February 2024

I'm chipping away at an update to go with the new [instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/myndatlas) and the most recent evolution of ideas.

The updates are sure to be sporadic.

<!-- Previous text: 
I've made a couple of attempts at moving this in a useful direction and I didn't get far enough with any of them to recommend spending much time here at this point. 

The experiment continues behind the scenes. I'm hoping that more of it will be reflected here before too long. I make no promises.


After a failed experiment with an upgrade I discovered that I prefer where I've ended up with this website. That's the nature of it sometimes, I suppose.


- I followed the instructions I found in the [Jekyll Garden](https://jekyll-garden.github.io) [How To](https://jekyll-garden.github.io/post/how-to) page.
- I have been using Obsidian Sync to get everything between devices which is working well, as ever.
- The Notes Feed seems to be working.
- I have been tweaking the code and adding things to move it in the direction I'm aiming for, just like I would "working in" my own note-system.
- I have been editing HTML directly on the github website from the iPad because there's something that keeps tripping me up about Working Copy and this is easier/faster than figuring it out, for now. This is a bad idea and I need to find an alternative - it's far more difficult to revert changes than I would like this way.
