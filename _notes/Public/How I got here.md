# How I got here

A friend first mentioned the idea to me in 2020 and I was interested but not at a point where I could do much with that interest (for health reasons[^1]). He later sent me Sonke Ahrens book [How to take Smart Notes](https://takesmartnotes.com/)  which I was finally able to start looking at over the holidays at the end of 2020. Before I even finished the book I wanted to get to work building notes and see what emerged from my process as I learned more. As my note-system was beginning to take some shape, I found and spent a lot of time pouring through [Zettelkasten.de](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) and [Andy Matuschak's Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes).

I started in an iOS app called [Bear](https://bear.app/) and merged to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) after it became available midway through 2021, some number of months and about 500 notes in.

Bear makes good use of wikilinks, tags, and a global search and using it let me get a feel for how a digital note-system might come together, but it wasn't long before I was finding limitations  I felt like I was making chaos and unable to get a handle on it or feel like I could even get a mental handle on sections in order to improve the situation. 

The migration required quite a bit of manual work which I was willing and have been able (bit by bit over years) to make into something useful. I feel like there ought to be better ways to get into this whole note-system experiment and get payoff sooner, if perhaps less organically than the way it's often described so far.

In Obsidian it is easy to transclude sections or entire notes, but the possibilities with [[Scratch Query Note]]s and [[Scratch Dataview Note]]s, not to mention Obsidian's [Graph View](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view) made it much easier to start to get a handle on the chaos I felt like I was making in Bear.

Although I've made a lot of headway, there continues to be a bit of chaos as I deveop better practices and learn more about the many options available in Obsidian. There's quite a lot to learn, but my note-system no longer feels quite so unwieldy and I can much more easily find what I need to and am slowly knocking it all into a more useful order.

Recent influences that have helped immensely include [Eleanor Konik](https://www.eleanorkonik.com), [Bryan Jenks](https://www.bryanjenks.dev), and now most recently [Jekyll Garden](https://jekyll-garden.github.io).
