# §Dashboard

I have experimented with a lot of versions of this note and with having dashboard-like sections on other notes. 

---
## Current Setup (as of 24-03-2023):

- A short list of links to the most likely-to-be-needed notes:
--- Today's note, this week's note, this month's note, this year's note

- A series of dataviews that catches tasks designated as commitments on planner pages in convenient (past/today/tomorrow/this week) type groupings.
