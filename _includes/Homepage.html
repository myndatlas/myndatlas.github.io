            The project: to document my forays into the development of a practice for tool-supported thinking. The tool is a note-system. (In the vein of a <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/book?seg_id=01HSJQEFG17HDAPCBB3DNSYYR2.15782.1711099305975">Second Brain</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">zettelkasten</a>, or <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes"> Evergreen Notes</a>.)

            It is an attempt to scaffold my ungovernable brain through big projects by working in a way that helps sporadic and intermittent work accumulate usefully.

           I hope it will ultimately be accessible to others, but it isn't yet. The aim is somewhere between "leaving a trail of breadcrumbs" and <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up">"working with the garage door up"</a>.

            The language at times is dense; this byproduct more than intentional choice, though I do somewhat enjoy it. The text here is sometimes slap-dash but often heavily refactored.
