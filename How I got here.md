# How I got here

I started my note-system in early 2021 after getting partway through Sonke Ahrens book [How to take Smart Notes](https://takesmartnotes.com/) over the holidays at the end of 2020. I wanted to get to work building notes and see what emerged from my process as I learned more. As my note-system was beginning to take some shape, I found and spent a lot of time pouring through [Zettelkasten.de](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) and [Andy Matuschak's Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes).

I started in an iOS app called [Bear](https://bear.app/) and merged to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) after it became available midway through 2021, some number of months and about 500 notes in.

Bear makes good use of wikilinks, tags, and a global search and using it let me get a feel for how a digital note-system might come together, but it wasn't long before I was finding limitations  I felt like I was making chaos and unable to get a handle on it or feel like I could even get a mental handle on sections in order to improve the situation. 

The migration required quite a bit of manual work, though so have a lot of aspects of trying to develop my own system.

In Obsidian it is easy to transclude sections or entire notes, but the possibilities with [[Scratch Query Note]]s and [[Scratch Dataview Note]]s, not to mention Obsidian's [Graph View](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view) made it much easier to start to get a handle on the chaos I felt like I was making in Bear.

Although I've made a lot of headway, there continues to be a bit of chaos as I deveop better practices and learn more about the many options available in Obsidian. There's quite a lot to learn, but my note-system no longer feels quite so unwieldy and I can much more easily find what I need to and am slowly knocking it all into a more useful order.

Recent influences that have helped immensely include [Eleanor Konik](https://www.eleanorkonik.com) and [Bryan Jenks](https://www.bryanjenks.dev).

I primarily use iOS devices (iPhone and iPad) though I do sometimes use an old MacBook Air and I have a [[Raspberry Pi 400]] that syncs everything to GitHub (as a backup for my main vault, and to keep this page updated for this vault).
