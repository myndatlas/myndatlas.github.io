# Scratch Dataview Note

NOTE: This is very out of date.

Like the [[§ScratchPad]] and [[Scratch Query Note]] the contents of this note change often. The note is permanently in the [[§ScratchBox]] for ease of access and use while working on other notes. It holds the bones of a dataview query to be modified as needed (to save me having to type it where that's convenient, especially when using Obsidian on my phone.)

The general template contains the below, inside a dataview code block:

LIST/TABLE/TASK
FROM
WHERE
SORT
