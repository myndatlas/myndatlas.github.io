# §Atlas
- [ ] To Do: Add a link/note for "The Dashboard"

In my note-system, this is the central page that everything links back to. Some might call it an index or register (especially if they've been reading about [Luhmann's Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)). If the rest of the notes are branches, this note is the one they all branch from.

Thus: everything in my note-system can be accessed following links from this note, via one or more paths through other notes.

I continue to experiment with different ways to have notes branch of from here and how to group them.

## My Current §Atlas Page has two main groups of notes on it:

1. A group of notes that are "in" the [[§ScratchBox]] (have it as the uplink).
		- The [[§ScratchBox]]
		- The [[§ScratchPad]]
		- The Dashboard

2. A List of the rest of the notes at the "section" level that branch off from the Atlas. They have a `§` in the note title and [[§Atlas]] note as a parent.  I have called these both atlasNotes and sectionNotes at various points.

Something about [Nick Milo's "Maps Of Content"](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/MOCs+Overview) (I don't want to just start using his term without deeper consideration but I'm not sure my AtlasNotes aren't conceptually quite similar to Maps of Content at least in some ways.)
